# About me
I am [*Gerson Matos*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gmatng/) a seasoned network and security engineer with over 20 years of experience, I have a wealth of knowledge and expertise in designing, implementing, and maintaining complex network and security systems. Throughout my career, I have successfully led teams in the deployment of network and security solutions for a variety of organizations, from small businesses to large enterprises. I am highly skilled in a wide range of technologies, including routers, switches, firewalls, and intrusion detection/prevention systems, and have a proven track record of delivering reliable and secure networks. I am also well-versed in industry best practices and standards, such as ISO 27001 and NIST 800-53, and am always looking for ways to improve the security and performance of the networks I manage.
And now I am working towards learning containers both Docker and Kubernetis and for this I decided to build a home lab where I'll start by deploying some services and document the process in hopes of being able to inspire people to join me in this journey.
